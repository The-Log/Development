** Classifiers
*** Data Driven Approach
- Collect data from internet
- Use ML to train an Model
- Evaluate Model with test data
*** Nearest Neighbor Classifier
- Finds objects that are similar using various functions such as Manhattan/Euclidean Distances and it finds shortest distance from them
- Manahattan (L1) Distance: finds absolute value difference between test and training images
- Euclidean (L2) Distance: finds distance by summing up square of difference between images
- Distances are hyperparameters
**** k-Nearest Neighbor
- Finds k nearest images, which has a vote for the label
- k is a hyperparameters
- Never used on images as it has awful test time and distance metrics are unintuitive
*** Linear Classification
