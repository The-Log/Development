* AI :  Uniformed vs Informal Search
**All Search
- Parts: Start, Goal, Transitions, Cost
- Completeness - Gets Solutions
- Optimal: Finds the least cost solution, best solution. Time doesn't matter
- Complexity: Find solution as fast as possible

*** Informed
- Can estimate the cost from the current state to the goal state.
- Dependent on cost, which is set in the expand function
- Ex. Djkastras
- Djkstras embedded in a Euclidean Space is a map
- Ex. for sliding eight puzzle, it would know which move would reach goal faster, by:
 1. Hamming Distance: looking for number blocks which are wrong
 2. Manhattan Distance: looking for how far from the Goal State ****
 - Larger distance measures find an fastest algorithm 

*** Uniformed
- Randomly does processes does not value the cost.
- Ex. BFS, DFS
- BFS: Complete and Optimal, but have to store the whole tree. Space complexity is wasteful.
--Space and Time O(b^(d))
- DFS: Not Complete Can not guerentee solution. Space complexity is minimum.
--Space is O(b*d) and Time is O(b^(d))
- Bounded Depth DFS - not infinite, still not complete.
--Space is O(b*l) and Time is O(b^(l))
- Iterative Deepening DFS -  Loop over maxDepth k [1,2,3,...,inf), complete, optimal solution, and complexity is minimum. (WIN WIN WIN)
--Space is O(b*d) and Time is O(b^(d))
